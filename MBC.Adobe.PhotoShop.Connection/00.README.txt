If you are examining this library, 
the path to follow is like this:

1. Start first with Utility.cs
   in Utility.cs, DerivePBKDF2Key function is the key point of PBKDF2 key gen.
   remember PhotoShop's PBKDF2 algorithm requires using only visible ASCII code,
   just stating in IsPhotoShopAcceptableString function.

2. Take a glance at Constants.cs
   there're constants what PhotoShop strictly requires.

3. EncryptDecrypt.cs
   "DESede/CBC/PKCS5Padding"(what PhotoShop uses) implementation resides.

4. IOHandler.cs / IOHandler.d01.Helper.cs
   main functionality about communication with PhotoShop resides here.

5. IOHandler.d02.BasicOperation.cs
   basic javascript execution resides here

6. IOHandler.d03.PhotoShopNotification.cs
   PhotoShop notification handling implementation resides here.

7. IOHandler.d04.PhotoShopAppAction.cs
   Pragmatic action's implementation resides here

8. javascript snippets worthy to read reside in JavascriptSnippet.cs

Have Fun!
